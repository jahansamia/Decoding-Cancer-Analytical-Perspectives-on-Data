Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, posing a significant challenge to global health.  Analyzing cancer-related data is crucial for understanding disease patterns, identifying risk factors, and developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. This analysis explores to investigate .  The insights gained will contribute to improved cancer control efforts and ultimately, better patient outcomes.

## Key Data:
The key data includes patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking status, family history), cancer characteristics (cancer type, stage, tumor size), treatment information (treatment type, treatment response), and outcomes (survival months, recurrence, genetic markers).

## Analytical Approach:
#### Descriptive Analysis:
Summarizing key characteristics of the data using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, frequency distributions) and visualizations (histograms, box plots, bar charts) to understand the distribution and patterns of variables.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Investigating relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and cross-tabulations to identify potential associations and trends.
#### Inferential Analysis: 
Conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of observed relationships and make inferences about the broader population of cancer patients.
#### Predictive Modeling:
Building statistical or machine learning models to predict outcomes, such as survival or treatment response, based on patient characteristics and treatment information.

## Objective:
The primary objective is to explore and understand patterns and relationships within the cancer patient data to gain insights into factors influencing cancer outcomes, such as survival, treatment response, and recurrence.
## Data Visualization Element:

* ![PowerBI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi)
* ![Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Project-1
## Excel-PowerBI-project:

This cancer data dashboard summarizes key patient demographics and cancer characteristics. It displays a near-equal gender distribution with 8,756 males and 8,930 females out of 17,686 total patients.  The dashboard features visualizations for age distribution, race/ethnicity breakdown, and potentially survival rates. Filters are available for gender, age, cancer type, and other clinical factors to allow for interactive exploration of the data.
Overall, the dashboard presents valuable cancer-related data but requires improvements in clarity, labeling, and context to maximize its effectiveness in informing insights and driving action.

### Project-2
## Python Project:
#### * Cancer type by Gender
![Cancer type by Gender](https://github.com/jahansamia/Decoding-Cancer-Analytical-Perspectives-on-Data/blob/d03e53d5041d72f65e8087a39a260f11ab2a4eeb/Pythone-image/Cancer-type-by-Gender.png)
This Histogram visualizes the distribution of cancer types by gender using a histogram. It utilizes plotly.express to create the histogram, with cancer types on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Bars are colored by gender and grouped for comparison. The visualization aids in understanding potential differences in cancer prevalence between genders.

#### Age distribution by cancer type and stage
![Age distribution by cancer type and stage](https://github.com/jahansamia/Decoding-Cancer-Analytical-Perspectives-on-Data/blob/7bdd637f38e66e3d494a1ceb4a49e4c83015fb90/Pythone-image/Age-distribution-by-cancer-type-and-stage.png)
The box plots show how age is distributed for each cancer type. We can see the median age, quartiles, and potential outliers for each cancer. The color-coding within each box plot allows us to see if certain cancer stages tend to occur at specific age ranges within a particular cancer type. By looking at the plot as a whole, we might identify overall trends, such as whether certain cancers are more common in younger or older patients, and how cancer stage might relate to age.

 #### Survival month vs cancer type
 ![Survival month vs cancer type](https://github.com/jahansamia/Decoding-Cancer-Analytical-Perspectives-on-Data/blob/714df0dc774a77d7661a1494519490d4cc47b697/Pythone-image/Survival-month-vs-cancer-type.png)
 The overall shape of the histogram reveals the general distribution of survival months across all cancer types. You can see whether survival times are skewed towards shorter or longer durations.By observing the color-coded bars, you can compare the survival distributions for different cancer types. Some cancer types might have longer survival times compared to others.

 #### BMI Distribution by Smoking Status and Family History
 ![BMI Distribution](https://github.com/jahansamia/Decoding-Cancer-Analytical-Perspectives-on-Data/blob/35a97518d4ed88a511302fc3f27739d09811b63b/Pythone-image/BMI-distribution-by-family-history.png)
The data used for this visualization is likely a dataset containing information about cancer patients, including their smoking status, BMI (Body Mass Index), and family history of cancer.This categorical variable is displayed on the x-axis, with different categories and BMI variable is plotted on the y-axis, representing the body mass index of the patients. Family History used for color-code the violin plots, allowing for comparison between patients with and without a family history of cancer. 
 
 
### Potential Results:
#### Cancer Prevalence and Demographics:
Analyzing the distribution of cancer types by gender, race/ethnicity, and age to identify potential disparities and risk factors.
#### Treatment Effectiveness:
Comparing treatment responses and survival months across different treatment types to assess their effectiveness.
#### Tumor Characteristics and Outcomes:
Investigating the relationship between tumor size, cancer stage, and survival to understand the impact of tumor characteristics on patient outcomes

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of cancer patient data, highlighting patterns related to prevalence, demographics, treatment outcomes, tumor characteristics, and potential risk factors. By examining these visualizations together, you can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between these factors and their impact on cancer patients.
